# Operating Systems Simulator

This project is a simulation of various operating system scheduling algorithms implemented using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a visual representation of how different scheduling algorithms work within an operating system environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A fast development server and build tool for modern web development.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for scripting.
- **HTML & CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the user interface.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
2. **Dining philosophers with semaphore**
3. **Clook disk scheduling algorithm**
4. **First in first out (FIFO)**

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
5. Access the simulator in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
